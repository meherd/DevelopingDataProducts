Overview:
========================================================

- The Joynerâ€“Boore Attenuation Data: 
This data gives peak accelerations measured at various observation stations for 23 earthquakes in California. The data have been used by various workers to estimate the attenuating affect of distance on ground acceleration.
- A data frame with 182 observations on these 5 variables.

1.	event (Event Number)
2.	mag	(Moment Magnitude)
3.  station	(Station Number)
4.	dist (Station-hypocenter distance (km))
5.  accel (Peak acceleration (g))
